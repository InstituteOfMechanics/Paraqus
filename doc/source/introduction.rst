Introduction
============

Paraqus is a Python package to convert simulation results, for example from finite element or CFD simulations, to the widely used and open *Visualization Toolkit* (VTK) file format. It was initially designed for the export of FE results from the commercial FE software `Abaqus <https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/abaqus>`_, but its modular structure allows it to be extended to other software.
VTK files can be visualized for example by the free and open source software `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.
Paraqus is intended for anyone who wants to convert simulation results, especially from Abaqus, to a non-proprietary format, either to use tools such as ParaView for their own visualizations, or to exchange data in an open format.
