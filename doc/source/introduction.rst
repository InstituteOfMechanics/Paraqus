Introduction
============

Paraqus is a Python package to convert simulation results, for example from finite element or CFD simulations, to the widely used and open ``.vtk`` file format. It was initially designed for the export of FE results from the commercial FE software `Abaqus <https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/abaqus>`_, but is designed to be extended for other softwares due to the modular structure.
VTK files can be visualised for example by the free and open source software `ParaView <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.
Paraqus is intented for anyone who wants to convert simulation results, especially from Abaqus, to a non-proprietary format, either to use tools such as ParaView for their own visualisations, or to exchange data in an open format.
