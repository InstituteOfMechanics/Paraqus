Dependencies
============

The only dependencies for Paraqus are Python 2.7 or higher and NumPy. When the Abaqus Python interpreter is used, NumPy is already installed by default. If Paraqus is installed via ``pip``, NumPy will be automatically installed as well. Paraqus was tested with NumPy 1.15.4 and above.

If Paraqus is used to export Abaqus results, Abaqus must be installed. Paraqus was tested with Abaqus versions 2023 and 2024.

Optional dependencies to compile the documentation are ``setuptools``, ``sphinx``, and ``sphinx-rtd-theme``, but we encourage the use of the online documentation.
