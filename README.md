# Paraqus

## Introduction

Paraqus is a Python package to convert simulation results, for example from finite element or CFD simulations, to the widely used and open .vtk file format. It was initially designed for the export of FE results from the commercial FE software Abaqus, but its modular structure allows it to be extended to other software. VTK files can be visualized for example by the free and open source software ParaView. Paraqus is intended for anyone who wants to convert simulation results, especially from Abaqus, to a non-proprietary format, either to use tools such as ParaView for their own visualizations, or to exchange data in an open format.
