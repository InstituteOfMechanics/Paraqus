## Submitting bug reports

If you encounter bugs or other problems with the software, please open an issue in the [github repository](https://github.com/tmfrln/paraqus). Make sure to include step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce the error. You should also specify what version of Paraqus (and, if applicable, Abaqus) you are using, as well as your operating system.

## Contributing to Paraqus

If you not only found a bug, but even found out how to get rid of it, we would appreciate if you would share your modifications. Please submit a pull request in the [github repository](https://github.com/tmfrln/paraqus). The same applies if you implemented a new feature, or made some other improvements. Pull requests will be reviewed by the authors before being merged into the main branch.

## Getting support
